            <p>I don't even know where to begin and I don't even know if I would be able to finish this on time while juggling my school life and personal things and making this.</p>
            <p>This section tells things that I like about you and being your friend</p>
            <p>You're supportive, you encourage people around you to be better and I was able to improve myself because of you. You're funny, I was able to laugh so much when I talk to you and a bad day would turn into a funny day. You're sweet, you take care of people and you care about their well-being and health and i hope you do the same to yourself. I still have so much more to say but I don't want this to be too long.</p>

            <summary>My message</summary>
            <p>So first of all I would like to thank you for everything. You're a great friend. Even though we are not talking as much as before due to us being more busy, I still appreciate every conversation we have. I don't know how to express my gratitude to you so I made this website for you even though I'm still not good at coding. This is literally the first website that I would publish, I'm not sure if i would be able to publish this successfully. The drawing that you see here are all made by me so it took even more time for me to finish this because not only I'm coding this, I'm also drawing some visuals for here. This is a pretty long message, are you still reading this? I wish you the bestest birthday! I hope that you will experience lots of great things. If you're having a hard time, you're always welcome to tell me and I would listen. Also keep this in mind, remember that everyone makes mistakes so don't be discouraged if you make some mistakes. You can start over. Make your mistakes a learning experience for you so you can avoid doing the same mistakes. Mistake means you're trying, it's better to try than to not try at all and it also means that you're a step closer to success. Progress isn't a straight line, it can go up and down. Progress also contains mistakes and errors however in the end, you would still reach success so don't give up.</p>
            <p>I have so much more to say however I don't want this message to be so long. Again, Happy Birthday to you!</p>
